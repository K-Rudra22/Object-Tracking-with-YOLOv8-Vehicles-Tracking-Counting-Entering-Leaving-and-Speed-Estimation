#  Object Tracking with YOLOv8: Vehicle Tracking, Counting & Speed Estimation  

This project demonstrates **real-time vehicle tracking, counting, and speed estimation** using **YOLOv8 object detection**, **object tracking**, and **homography-based distance calibration**.  

The system can:  
-  Detect vehicles in a video stream using YOLOv8  
-  Track vehicles across frames (with unique IDs)  
-  Count vehicles entering & leaving a scene  
-  Estimate vehicle speeds (pixels → real-world meters using homography)  
-  Display total vehicles, live counts, and speed overlays  
-  Run locally or be deployed as a **Streamlit app**

##  Features  
- **YOLOv8 Detection** – State-of-the-art object detection model  
- **Object Tracking** – Keeps IDs consistent for each vehicle  
- **Vehicle Counting** – Tracks entry & exit counts  
- **Speed Estimation** – Uses FPS + homography calibration for approximate real-world speeds  
- **Custom Overlay UI** – Clear badges for counts, IDs, and speeds on video output  
- **Streamlit Deployment** – Run interactively from a browser
