Overview
This project demonstrates real-time vehicle tracking, counting, and speed estimation using YOLOv8 object detection combined with object tracking and homography-based distance calibration.
The system can:
‚Ä¢	Detect vehicles in a video stream using YOLOv8.
‚Ä¢	Track vehicles across frames (with unique IDs).
‚Ä¢	 Count vehicles entering & leaving a scene.
‚Ä¢	 Estimate vehicle speeds (pixels ‚Üí real-world meters using homography).
‚Ä¢	 Display total vehicles, live counts, and speed overlays with improved visibility.
‚Ä¢	 Run locally or be deployed as a Streamlit app.
